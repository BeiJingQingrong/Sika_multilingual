# Invitation to Collaborate on Multi-language Module

## Project Overview

Welcome to the multi-language module development page for our game project! We are working on an exciting game based on Mount&Blade2.And we want to localize it into multiple languages so players around the world can enjoy it. For this, we need your support ! <3

## Multilingual Task Details

Since mount&blade2 is a popular game all over the world, we would like to express as much of the storyline as possible during the development process, so please point out any translation, spelling mistakes, etc. in our multilingual modules.

Since this project is open source, you can upload your modifications directly and we will review them, thanks for your support!
